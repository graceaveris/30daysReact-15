**Day Sixteen - 30 days of React challenge - "Random Holiday Destination" app**

Today i've connected with Google Maps API to create a simple app that generates a random holiday destination, and shows you on a map with a label.

**Concepts Explored:**
- Using Google Maps API with React
- Integration of google-maps-react npm
- Managing external components from library
- Fetch with API

Follow me *programming noob* as I stumble my way through self-learning React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
