# 30daysReact-15
Day Fifteen // 30 days of React challenge // "Random Holiday Destination" app

With this app i've connected to googple maps API to greate a random holiday destination generator.

Follow me programming noob as I stumble my way through self-learning React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned.

By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
